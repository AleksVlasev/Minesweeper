# Minesweeper

Here I have recreated the classic Minesweeper game as an exercise in software development. So far the game exists as a cmd implementation in Python but I plan to add a proper GUI soon too (just don't know how yet).

I started with recalling most of the game mechanics and thinking about how one could implement them in Python. I wrote most of it on paper since I was away from my computer. Once I started writing it on my computer I made a whole bunch of changes but the core ideas remained the same. The parts that I had not written out actually took longer to write on my computer than if I had written them out on paper first and then on the computer.
